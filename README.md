## Prerequisites 

- 3 virtual machines (VMs) up and running in the same subnet / VPC. We are using EC2 instances on the AWS Cloud for this how-to guide. One of the VMs need to have 2 vCPUs and 4 GB RAM, which means at least a `t2.medium` instance type. Rest of the VMs can be `t2.micro` instances.
- **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS** OS on all machines. 
- Familiarity with the [Kubernetes Components](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/).
- On-Primises should have three VMs or Three Physical servers with communication enabled between them (Network)

## Part A - Controller and Worker Nodes

1. Configure Network Prerequisites 

    This step configures IPv4 forwarding and lets iptables see bridged traffic. The `overlay` module is needed by Docker to work with the overlay network driver. The `br_netfilter` module is needed by Kubernetes to enable network filtering and NAT (Network Address Translation).

    Refer to [this Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/container-runtimes/#forwarding-ipv4-and-letting-iptables-see-bridged-traffic/) for more information.

    1.   
        ```
        cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/modules-load.d/k8s.conf
        overlay
        br_netfilter
        EOF
        ```
    1.  
        ```
        sudo modprobe overlay
        sudo modprobe br_netfilter
        ```        
    1. 
        ```
        cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/k8s.conf
        net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables  = 1
        net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables = 1
        net.ipv4.ip_forward                 = 1
        EOF
        ```
    1. 
        ```
        sudo sysctl --system
        ```
    1.  
        ```
        lsmod | grep overlay
        ```
        Confirm that you see an output similar to the following:

        ```
        overlay               151552  0
        ```    
    1.  
        ```
        lsmod | grep br_netfilter
        ```
        Confirm that you see an output similar to the following:

        ```
        br_netfilter           28672  0
        bridge                307200  1 br_netfilter
        ```
    1. Verify that the `net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables`, `net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables`, and `net.ipv4.ip_forward` system variables are set to 1 in your `sysctl` config by running the following command:
        ```
        sysctl net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables net.ipv4.ip_forward
        ```
        
        **Output**
       ```
        net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables = 1
        net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables = 1
        net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1

        ```

    Ensure to run these steps to configure the required network settings on **all** nodes.

1. Configure Container Runtime

    This step configures container runtime for all nodes on the cluster. Kubernetes 1.28 requires that you use a runtime that conforms with the Container Runtime Interface (CRI), which is an API for container run-times to work with `kubelet`. We will use `containerd` as the container runtime for this Kubernetes cluster.

    Refer to [this Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/container-runtimes/#container-runtimes) for more information.

    1. Install Docker Engine (as it includes `containerd` runtime).

        Refer to [this Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository) for more information.

        1. Update the `apt` package index, install the required packages, and get the official GPG keys for the Docker package repositories:
            ```
            sudo apt-get update
            sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl gnupg
            sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
            curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
            sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
           ``` 
        1. Add the Docker repository to the `apt` sources:
            ```
            echo \
            "deb [arch="$(dpkg --print-architecture)" signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
            "$(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME")" stable" | \
            sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
            ```
        1. Update the `apt` package index, again:
            ```
            sudo apt-get update
            ```
        1. Install Docker (including `containerd`):
            ```
            sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
            ```
        1. Make daemon file for docker to aviod service errors later
        ```
            sudo mkdir /etc/docker
            cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/docker/daemon.json
            {
              "exec-opts": ["native.cgroupdriver=systemd"],
              "log-driver": "json-file",
              "log-opts": {
              "max-size": "100m"
              },
              "storage-driver": "overlay2"
              }
              EOF
       
            sudo systemctl enable docker
            sudo systemctl daemon-reload
            sudo systemctl restart docker
        ```
        1. Confirm that Docker Engine installation is successful by running the `hello-world` image:
            ```
            sudo docker run hello-world
            ```
        1. Switch-off the swap in all the nodes
            ```
            sudo swapoff -a
            sudo sed -i '/ swap / s/^\(.*\)$/#\1/g' /etc/fstab
            ```            
    1. Configure the `containerd` runtime environment.

        Refer to [this Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/container-runtimes/#containerd) for more information.

        1. Login as root:
            ```
            sudo -i
            ```
        1. Create a default `containerd` configuration file:
            ```
            containerd config default > /etc/containerd/config.toml
            ```
        1. Open `config.toml` in a text editor:
            ```
            vi /etc/containerd/config.toml
            ```
        1. Change the value of `SystemdCgroup` from `false` to `true` (it should be visible around line number 125 in `config.toml`):
            ```
            SystemdCgroup = true
            ```
        1. Restart `containerd`
            ```
            systemctl restart containerd
            ```
        1. Exit the `sudo` mode:
            ```
            exit
            ```
    Ensure to run these steps to configure the container runtime on **all** nodes.

1. Install `kubeadm`, `kubelet`, and `kubectl`

    In this step, we install these packages on **all** nodes:
    * `kubeadm`: The command to bootstrap the cluster
    * `kubelet`: An agent that runs on all nodes in the cluster and does things like starting pods and containers
    * `kubectl`: The command line utility to talk to the cluster

    Refer to [this Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/install-kubeadm/#installing-kubeadm-kubelet-and-kubectl) for more information.

    Since we are using Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, we will use instructions for Debian-based distributions.

    1. Update the `apt` package index, install the required packages, and get the official GPG keys for the Kubernetes package repositories:
        ```
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl
        curl -fsSL https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/v1.28/deb/Release.key | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-apt-keyring.gpg
        ```
    1. Add the Kubernetes repository to the `apt` sources:
        ```
        echo 'deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-apt-keyring.gpg] https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/v1.28/deb/ /' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list
        ```
    1. Update the `apt` package index, again:
        ```
        sudo apt-get update
        ```
    1. Install `kubelet`, `kubeadm`, and `kubectl`:
        ```
        sudo apt-get install -y kubelet kubeadm kubectl
        ```
    1. Pin their version (avoids automatic updates):
        ```
        sudo apt-mark hold kubelet kubeadm kubectl
        ```
    Ensure to install `kubeadm`, `kubelet`, and `kubectl` on **all** nodes.


## Part B - Controller Node ONLY

Run these commands only on the VM designated as the controller (master) node.

1. (RUN AS ROOT) Initiate API server:

    1. 
        ```
        sudo -i
        ```
    1. Initiate the API server. Remember to change the `<ControllerVM-PrivateIP>` with the actual private IP address of the controller VM: 
        ```
        kubeadm init --apiserver-advertise-address=<ControllerVM-PrivateIP> --pod-network-cidr=10.244.0.0/16 
        ```
    1. Exit the sudo mode
        ```
        exit
        ```
1. (RUN AS NORMAL USER) Add a user for kube config:
    
    1. 
        ```
        mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
        sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
        sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config
        ```
1. (RUN AS NORMAL USER) Deploy Weave network:
    ```
    kubectl apply -f https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/releases/download/v2.8.1/weave-daemonset-k8s.yaml
    ```
1. (RUN AS ROOT) Create cluster join command:
    
    1. 
        ```
        sudo -i
        ```
    1. 
        ```
        kubeadm token create --print-join-command
        ```
## Part C - Worker Nodes ONLY

Copy the output of the cluster join command from the previous step and run on the VMs designated as the worker nodes.

(EXAMPLE COMMAND - DO NOT USE):
```
sudo kubeadm join 192.168.175.100:6443 --token jno9md.v9u1snltrwkv3vix --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:74b58d0e840e43a7051dcc4d7388b836dbd187c732fbfd3008051d10a14e271a
```
The Kubernetes cluster is now configured.

1. Now check the status of the nodes and cluster (RUN as NORMAL User)
```
kubectl get nodes
```
