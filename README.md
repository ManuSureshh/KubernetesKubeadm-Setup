## Prerequisites 

- 3 virtual machines (VMs) up and running in the same subnet / VPC. We are using EC2 instances on the AWS Cloud for this how-to guide. One of the VMs need to have 2 vCPUs and 4 GB RAM, which means at least a `t2.medium` instance type. Rest of the VMs can be `t2.micro` instances.
- **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS** OS on all machines. 
- Familiarity with the [Kubernetes Components](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/).
- On-Primises should have three VMs or Three Physical servers with communication enabled between them (Network)
